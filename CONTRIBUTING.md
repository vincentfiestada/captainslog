## Style

Go code must be formatted with [gofmt](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/) and follow the [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) guidelines.

This project adheres to the [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) specifications.

## Getting Started

The `hooks` directory contains scripts that enforce the style guide and run tests before every commit. You can set them up by running `task install-hooks`.
